# Python to Tex

### In this repo you will find
* The folder ```Examples``` which contains a ready-to-use example
* The file ```py2tex.py``` which parses the Python ast
* The file ```py2tex.sty``` the style of the pseudocode (at the moment it uses the Standard chosen in the Italian Olympiads in Informatics)
